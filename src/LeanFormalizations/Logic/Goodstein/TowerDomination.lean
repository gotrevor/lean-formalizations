# The FULL ω-power tower: diagonal domination at every level up to ε₀

Lap 10 closed the diagonal `f_o(m) ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2` at the individual limit levels
`o = ω`, `o = ω^j` (finite `j`), and `o = ω^ω` (`DominationOmega.lean`), each by an *ad hoc* bridge.
This file makes the climb **general in one stroke**: it proves the diagonal domination at EVERY
ω-power-tower level `o = ω↑↑k` (`towerO k`, `repr = ω↑↑k`), for every `k`, unconditionally and
machine-checked. Since `sup_k ω↑↑k = ε₀`, this is Cichoń's lower bound at a cofinal family of levels
below `ε₀` — the destination of the expedition (`DIRECTION.md`: "`goodsteinLength` grows like
`f_{ε₀}`").

The proof rests on two general engines, each subsuming its per-level predecessors:

1. **The general length bootstrap** `two_mul_le_goodsteinLength_iter`:
   `goodsteinLength ((log₂)^[k] m) ≥ 2m` for every `k`. The key realization is that the *already
   proved* `o = ω` domination is strong enough at every depth — no `f_{ω^ω}`-strength bound at the
   deep seed is needed (the worry recorded in the lap-10 handoff). What carries it is the clean
   finite-level **tower lower bound** `towerN_le_fastGrowing`: `f_{k+2}(t) ≥ towerN (k+1) (t+1)`
   (an `(k+1)`-fold iterated exponential), proved by induction on `k`. Composed with
   `f_ω(t) = f_{t+1}(t) ≥ f_{k+2}(t)` (index monotonicity) and the tower upper bound on `m`
   (`succ_le_towerN_log_iter`: `m + 1 ≤ towerN k ((log₂)^[k] m + 1)`), the `f_ω` length bound clears
   `2m` at every depth. This subsumes `two_mul_le_goodsteinLength_log` (k=1) and
   `two_mul_le_goodsteinLength_loglog` (k=2).

2. **The general ordinal bridge** `omegaTower_succ_le_seqONote_repr`: if the descent's `k`-fold
   leading exponent is in the large regime (`base i ≤ (log_{base i})^[k] (G_i)`), then the descent
   ordinal dominates `ω↑↑(k+1)`. Pure `toOrdinal` induction (`omegaTower_le_toOrdinal`), peeling one
   `Nat.log` per step. This subsumes `omega_omega_le_seqONote_repr` (k=1) and
   `omega_pow_omega_le_seqONote_repr` (k=2).

The crux at step `i = m − 2` is discharged by the self-similarity tower `iterLeadExp_dominates`
(read at a fixed index via `logSeq_iterate_apply`) feeding `n_le_goodsteinSeq` the bootstrap length
bound. Everything below is unconditional; the unconditional closures carry the finite-base-case
`native_decide` axioms (documented split) inherited through the `f_ω` bootstrap.

/-- **The general finite-level tower lower bound (Claim B).** For every `k` and every `t ≥ 2`,
`towerN (k+1) (t+1) ≤ f_{k+2}(t)`: the `(k+2)`-nd fast-growing function at `t` dominates an
`(k+1)`-fold iterated exponential of `t+1`. By induction on `k`, using `f_{n+1}(t) = (f_n)^[t](t)`
(`fastGrowing_succ`), `(f)^[t] t ≥ (f)^[2] t = f(f(t))` (iterate monotonicity + `id ≤ f`), and the
IH applied twice — the inner application keeps the argument `≥ 2`, the outer lifts a tower height.
This is the engine that makes the *already proved* `o = ω` domination strong enough at every depth:
no deeper fast-growing bound is needed. -/

/-- **THE GENERAL LENGTH BOOTSTRAP.** For every `k`, with the `k`-fold log seed `≥ 2^16` (and `≥ k+1`,
so `f_ω = f_{·+1}` reaches index `k+2`), the seed-`((log₂)^[k] m)` Goodstein descent runs at least
`2m` steps: `goodsteinLength ((log₂)^[k] m) ≥ 2m`.

The bound is proved from the **`o = ω` domination alone**, at every depth:
`goodsteinLength t ≥ f_ω(t) − 2 = f_{t+1}(t) − 2 ≥ f_{k+2}(t) − 2 ≥ towerN (k+1) (t+1) − 2 ≥
2^{m+1} − 2 ≥ 2m`, where `t = (log₂)^[k] m`. The last steps use `succ_le_towerN_log_iter`

/-! ### Explicit thresholds and the ε₀ headline -/

is large. By induction on `k` via `Nat.le_log_of_pow_le`. -/

/-- **Explicit-threshold form of the general diagonal domination.** For every `k` and every
`m ≥ towerN k (2^16 + k)` (a tower of height `k` over `2^16 + k`),
`fastGrowing (towerO k) m ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2`. The single threshold supplies both hypotheses of
`fastGrowing_towerO_le_goodsteinLength` (`2^16 ≤ (log₂)^[k] m` and `k+1 ≤ (log₂)^[k] m`). -/

/-- **THE ε₀ HEADLINE.** For every ω-power-tower level `k`, `goodsteinLength` eventually dominates
`f_{ω↑↑k}`: there is a threshold `N` (namely `towerN k (2^16 + k)`) past which
`fastGrowing (towerO k) m ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2`. Since `{ω↑↑k}` is cofinal in `ε₀`, this is
Cichoń's lower bound `goodsteinLength m + 2 ≥ f_o(m)` (eventually) for a family of `o` cofinal below
`ε₀` — the expedition's destination, fully machine-checked and unconditional. -/
theorem goodsteinLength_eventually_dominates_fastGrowing_towerO (k : ℕ) :
    ∃ N, ∀ m, N ≤ m → fastGrowing (towerO k) m ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2 :=
  ⟨towerN k (2 ^ 16 + k), fun _ hm => goodsteinLength_dominates_fastGrowing_towerO hm⟩

/-- **THE FULL ε₀ HEADLINE — Cichoń's lower bound for every `o < ε₀`.** For EVERY normal-form
`ONote` `o` (every ordinal `< ε₀`), `goodsteinLength` eventually dominates `f_o`: there is a threshold
`N` past which `fastGrowing o m ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2`. This is the complete diagonal lower bound —
not merely along the tower spine `ω↑↑k`, but at *every* ordinal below `ε₀` — the destination of the
expedition (`DIRECTION.md`), unconditional and machine-checked.

Proof: `exists_repr_lt_omegaTower` places `o` below some tower level `ω↑↑k` (cofinality of the tower
in `ε₀`); the threshold `N = max (towerN k (2^16+k)) (norm o)` supplies the deep-seed bound and the
budget `norm o ≤ m`; then `fastGrowing_le_goodsteinLength_of_repr_le_tower` (whose descent dominates
`ω↑↑(k+1) ≥ ω^{repr o}`) closes it. Carries the finite-base-case `native_decide` axioms (documented
split), inherited via the `f_ω` length bootstrap. -/

/-- Anti-vacuity: the tower notation unfolds to the concrete `oadd` forms the per-level closures
used, and carries the genuine ε₀-approaching reprs — so the general theorem really subsumes them. -/
