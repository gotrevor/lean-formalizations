# Toward `o = ω`: the limit-level diagonal, isolated to its crux

With the finite-level diagonal `f_n(m) ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2` closed
(`DominationBaseCases.lean`), the next tier of Cichoń's lower bound is the **limit ordinal `ω`**:
`f_ω(m) ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2`. This file builds the ordinal bridge for `ω^ω` and reduces the
`o = ω` diagonal to a single open hypothesis — exactly the way `Domination.lean`'s
`goodstein_dominates_of_index` framed the finite levels in lap 6.

The crux it isolates: the descent's **leading exponent stays in the LARGE regime** (`≥ base`) at step
`m − 2`. For finite `o = n` we only needed `leadExp ≥ n` (a fixed constant); for `o = ω` we need
`leadExp ≥ base = m`, i.e. the leading exponent itself reaches `ω` at the ordinal level. This is one
recursion deeper than the lap-9 self-similarity (see `PENDING_WORK.md` → "NEXT FRONTIER"), and is the
genuine remaining growth content — NOT to be axiomatized.

/-- **Ordinal bridge for `ω^ω`.** If the leading exponent of `G_i` is in the *large regime*
(`base i ≤ log_{base i} G_i`), the descent ordinal dominates `ω^ω`: the leading CNF exponent
`toOrdinal (base i) (leadExp)` is then `≥ toOrdinal (base i) (base i) = ω`, so the leading term is
`≥ ω^ω`. The `ω`-level analog of `opow_le_seqONote_repr` (which handled finite exponents `ω^k`). -/

/-- **The `o = ω` diagonal domination, REDUCED to its crux** (`hreg`). If the Goodstein descent's
leading exponent is still in the LARGE regime at step `m − 2` (`base (m−2) ≤ leadExp_{m−2}`), then
`fastGrowing ω m ≤ goodsteinLength m + 2` (with `ω = oadd 1 1 0`). Assembly mirrors the finite-level
`fastGrowing_ofNat_le_goodsteinLength_of_log_length`: the large-regime hypothesis gives
`ω^ω ≤ (seqONote m (m−2)).repr` (`omega_omega_le_seqONote_repr`); the diagonal reduction
`goodstein_dominates_of_index_le` (budget `m`) closes it. **The hypothesis `hreg` IS Cichoń's lower
bound at the limit level `ω`** — the open obligation for the next lap (route (a) in `PENDING_WORK.md`:
iterate the self-similarity so the one-level-down value stays `≥ base` for `~m` steps). -/

/-- Anti-vacuity: `ω = oadd 1 1 0` really has `repr = ω`, and `oadd ω 1 0` has `repr = ω^ω` — so the
reduction targets the genuine limit level, not a finite stand-in. -/
