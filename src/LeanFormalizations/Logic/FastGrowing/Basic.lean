# Growth theory of the fast-growing hierarchy

`Mathlib.SetTheory.Ordinal.Notation` already provides the **fast-growing hierarchy**
on ordinal notations below `ε₀`:

* `ONote.fastGrowing : ONote → ℕ → ℕ`  with `f₀ = succ`, `f_{α+1} = fun n => f_α^[n] n`,
  `f_λ = fun n => f_{λ[n]} n` (limit `λ`, via `ONote.fundamentalSequence`);
* `ONote.fastGrowingε₀ : ℕ → ℕ`, the one-step extension to `ε₀` itself.

mathlib proves the *small values* (`fastGrowing_one = (2 * ·)`, `fastGrowing_two = fun n => 2^n * n`,
`fastGrowingε₀_zero = 1`, `fastGrowingε₀_one = 2`) but **none of the growth theory**:
no expansiveness, no monotonicity, no domination. Those are exactly the facts the
Kirby–Paris growth argument needs, and they are the targets here.

These lemmas are mathlib-PR-shaped (they belong next to `ONote.fastGrowing`); developing
them here both serves the Goodstein-independence growth content and is independently useful.

## Normal-form hypotheses
`fastGrowing` is total on all of `ONote`, but the intended (and provable) statements
hold for **normal-form** notations (`ONote.NF`). Carry `[o.NF]`/`(h : o.NF)` where the
proof needs it; the `fundamentalSequence` correctness lemmas
(`ONote.fundamentalSequence_has_prop`, `ONote.FundamentalSequenceProp`) and the
`fastGrowing_zero'/_succ/_limit` characterizations are the entry points.

/-- **Expansiveness.** Every level of the fast-growing hierarchy dominates the
identity: `n ≤ f_o(n)` for every notation `o` (no normal-form hypothesis needed —
`fundamentalSequence_has_prop` holds for all `o`).

Proof by well-founded recursion on `o` (the same `<`-recursion that *defines*
`fastGrowing`), via the three characterizations `fastGrowing_zero'/_succ/_limit`:
* `o = 0`: `f_o = Nat.succ`, so `n ≤ n+1`.
* successor `o = a+1`: `f_o n = (f_a)^[n] n`; by IH `id ≤ f_a`, and iterating a
  function that dominates the identity stays `≥ id` (`id_le_iterate_of_id_le`).
* limit: `f_o n = f_{o[n]} n` with `o[n] < o`, so the IH applies directly. -/

If `o` is the successor of `a` (`fundamentalSequence o = inl (some a)`), then for a
positive argument the next index can only grow the value:
`f_a(n) ≤ f_o(n)`. Indeed `f_o n = (f_a)^[n] n ≥ (f_a)^[1] n = f_a n` once `1 ≤ n`. -/

/-- **Structural descent relation** `Reaches x β α`: from `β` one can step down to `α`
through `fundamentalSequence`, using *predecessor* steps at successor notations and
*index-`x`* steps at limit notations. This is a purely structural (no `fastGrowing`)
relation on `ONote`, and it is exactly the "Bachmann path" along which the fast-growing
hierarchy is monotone in the index. -/

/-- **Value transfer (the analytic side, fully proved axiom-clean).** If `β` reaches `α`
structurally with positive budget `x`, then `f_α(x) ≤ f_β(x)`. Each step is justified:
a predecessor step by `fastGrowing_le_succ_index` (iterating an expansive map), a
limit-`x` step by `fastGrowing_limit` (definitional equality). This reduces *all* index
monotonicity of the fast-growing hierarchy to the structural `Reaches` relation. -/

argument, `f_{g m}(x) ≤ f_{g n}(x)`: just telescope `fastGrowing_le_succ_index`.

This is the reusable core behind every "successor-chain" index comparison —
finite levels (`g = ofNat`), `β+ω` limits, and the *finite slices* `β, β+1, β+2, …`
of a limit's own fundamental sequence (which is how the limit-of-limits residue is
attacked: each `o[n+1]` is reached from `o[n]` by finitely many successor steps). -/

reduction machinery is sound on a genuine limit ordinal.

/-- **The Bachmann reachability crux (A3, structural form).**  *(disclosed `sorry` — the
genuine hard core, now stated entirely structurally, free of `fastGrowing`.)*

For a limit notation `o` with fundamental sequence `f`, the *next* index `f (n+1)`
structurally reaches the *current* index `f n` with budget `n+1`:
`Reaches (n+1) (f (n+1)) (f n)`.

This is the **Bachmann property** of the standard CNF fundamental sequences: the descent
of `f (n+1)` (at the fixed index `n+1`) passes *exactly* through `f n` — because the
`ONote` fundamental sequence descends tails first and the coefficients pass through every
integer value, so no tail "overshoots". Once this is proved, *all* index monotonicity of
the fast-growing hierarchy follows from `fastGrowing_le_of_reaches` (already proved).

This is strictly sharper than the old analytic `sorry`: it isolates the difficulty into a
pure statement about `fundamentalSequence`, attackable by structural induction on `o` and
verifiable by `native_decide` on concrete notations. The successor-chain and `ω^2` cases
are already discharged (`fastGrowing_fundSeq_step_of_succ`, `fastGrowing_omega_sq_…`). -/

    Reaches (n + 1) (f (n + 1)) (f n) := by
  sorry

/-- **The index-monotonicity crux (A3), limit step** — now a corollary of the structural
Bachmann reachability via the value-transfer lemma. For a limit `o` with fundamental
sequence `f`, `f_{o[n]}(n+1) ≤ f_{o[n+1]}(n+1)`. -/

  fastGrowing_le_of_reaches (Nat.succ_le_succ (Nat.zero_le n)) (fastGrowing_bachmann_reach h n)

/-- **The crux for "successor-chain" limits** — proved in full (axiom-clean).
Whenever the fundamental sequence of `o` is a *successor chain*, i.e. each `f (n+1)`
is the notation-successor of `f n` (`fundamentalSequence (f (n+1)) = inl (some (f n))`),
the index step is just `fastGrowing_le_succ_index`. This covers every limit of the form
`β + ω` (e.g. `ω, ω·k, ω+k`), whose fundamental sequence increments a finite tail.

Consequently the remaining genuine difficulty in `fastGrowing_fundSeq_step` lives
*only* at limits-of-limits (`ω^ω`, `ω^(ω+1)`, …), where `f n` is itself a limit and the
chain is not successor-stepwise — that is the sharp residue of the A3 crux. -/

  fastGrowing_le_succ_index (hsucc n) (Nat.succ_le_succ (Nat.zero_le n))

/-- **Monotonicity propagates across a successor step.** If `o` is the notation-successor
of `a` (`fundamentalSequence o = inl (some a)`) and `f_a` is monotone, then so is `f_o`:
`f_o n = (f_a)^[n] n`, and iterating a monotone, `≥ id` map preserves monotonicity in the
diagonal `n ↦ (f_a)^[n] n`. (The successor companion of `fastGrowing_le_succ_index`, at the
level of the whole `Monotone` predicate.) -/

    _ ≤ (fastGrowing a)^[q] q := (Function.monotone_iterate_of_id_le hexp hpq) q

/-- **Monotonicity for successor-chain limits — the general engine, axiom-clean.**
If `o` is a limit whose fundamental sequence `f` is a *successor chain*
(`fundamentalSequence (f (k+1)) = inl (some (f k))`), then `f_o` is monotone *provided
only the bottom level `f 0` is monotone*: monotonicity of every `f k` then follows from
`fastGrowing_monotone_succ` along the chain, and the limit step is discharged by
`fastGrowing_fundSeq_step_of_succ`.

This is the clean companion to `fastGrowing_fundSeq_step_of_succ`: it lifts the *index
step* to the whole `Monotone` predicate, and covers every `β + ω`-type limit (`ω`, `ω·k`,
`β+ω`) in one stroke. The genuinely hard residue (`ω^ω`, `ω^(ω+1)`, …) — where the
fundamental sequence is not a successor chain — remains in `fastGrowing_fundSeq_step`. -/

sequence is the successor chain `n ↦ ofNat (n+1)`, whose bottom level `f_{ofNat 1}` is
